This is my tech blog

It is styled with flexbox and has a nice neon light logo.

each article has a card with shadows and you can press on the article to open it up in a new seperate page from the index.html page.

It's design is pretty minimal and dark which I find aesthetically pleasing on a bright computer screen.
