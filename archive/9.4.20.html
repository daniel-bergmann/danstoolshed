                <h2 class="card-title">Button UI design</h2>
                <h4>9.4.20</h4>
  
                <p>Whether we like it or not, pressing buttons has become part of our daily habits.</p>
  
                <p>When we wake up, we press a button. When we make our cup of coffee we press a button. While we wait for the bus, we press a button to see where the bus is located...</p>
  
                <p>Most of the time the button is on a screen while sometimes the button is stuck to a metal pole and we press it to notify a bus driver to stop for us.</p>
  
                <p>When we press these buttons, there are electric functions that go off and provide us with the service which we desire at each given time. Be it stopping the bus or ordering pizza through an app.</p>
  
                <p>Careful thought and consideration go into each and every one of those buttons yet most of the time (hopefully) we don't notice them. Thats because they are designed well.</p>
  
                <p>When it comes to designing a user interface, users need to be able to see right away if something can be clicked. the longer it takes a person to click a button the less usable it is. Get rid of a unused button in the next update.</p>
  
                <p>When designing a button it's important to have in mind clear affordances in design. A person uses previous experience and visual signifiers to clarify the meaning of an UI object. Thats why it's important to use appropriate visual signifiers like shape, color and shadow for example.</p>
  
                <p>White space is as important to design as the UI components. The amount of whitespace near the button makes it easier or harder for users to understand whether it's an interactive component or not.</p>
  
                <p>Users are pressing buttons all day long so don't make them have to look for yours</p>
  
                <p>When I press a button in my online bank account system. The design is pretty straight forward. The button that confirms a transfer is usually green which is the color of initiation in my mind. Stop light designers have gone through the same thought process. Make the most important button look like it's the most important one.</p>
  
                <p>Finger friendlyness is a thing. A <a class="link-underline" href="http://touchlab.mit.edu/publications/2003_009.pdf">MIT touch Lab</a> study found that averages for finger pads are between 10–14mm and fingertips are 8–10mm. This makes 10mm x 10mm a good minimum touch target size.</p>
  
                <p>If we can't start a video on a screen because of our fat fingers, blame the designer, not the person.</p>
